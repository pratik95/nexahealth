<h style="font-size:200%;">How can you provide first-aid care for a broken bone?</h><br>
<p><b>If you suspect that someone has a broken bone, provide first-aid treatment and help them get professional care:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Stop any bleeding:</b> If they’re bleeding, elevate and apply pressure to the wound using a sterile bandage, a clean cloth, or a clean piece of clothing.</li></ul><br>
<li><b>Immobilize the injured area:</b> If you suspect they’ve broken a bone in their neck or back, help them stay as still as possible. If you suspect they’ve broken a bone in one of their limbs, immobilize the area using a splint or sling.</li></ul><br>
<li><b>Apply cold to the area:</b> Wrap an ice pack or bag of ice cubes in a piece of cloth and apply it to the injured area for up to 10 minutes at a time.</li></ul><br>
<li><b>Treat them for shock:</b> Help them get into a comfortable position, encourage them to rest, and reassure them. Cover them with a blanket or clothing to keep them warm.</li></ul><br>
<li><b>Get professional help:</b> Call 911 or help them get to the emergency department for professional care.</li></ul><br>
<p style="color:green;"><strong>If the person doesn’t appear to be breathing, is unconscious, or both, call 911 for medical help and begin CPR. You should also call 911 if:<strong></p>
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>you suspect they’ve broken a bone in their head, neck, or back</li>
<li>the fractured bone has pushed through their skin</li>
<li>they’re bleeding heavily</li><br><br><br>
</ul>
<p><strong>Otherwise, help them get to the emergency department by car or other<br> means so a doctor can diagnose their condition and recommend <br>appropriate treatment.</strong></p>
