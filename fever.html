 <h1 style="font-size:250%; text-align:center;color:blue;">First aid for high fever </h1>
 <br>
<h style="font-size:250%;color:green"> SYMPTOM</h><br><br>
<p><b>Call your doctor immediately if any of these signs or symptoms accompanies a fever:</b><p>
<ul>
<li>A severe headache</li><br>
<li>Severe swelling of the throat</li><br>
<li>Unusual skin rash</li><br>
<li>Unusual eye sensitivity to bright light</li><br>
<li>A stiff neck and pain when the head is bent forward</li><br>
<li>Mental confusion</li><br>
<li>Persistent vomiting</li><br>
<li>Difficulty breathing or chest pain</li><br>
<li>Extreme listlessness or irritability</li><br>
<li>Abdominal pain or pain when urinating</li><br>
<li>Any other unexplained symptoms</li><br>
</ul>
<p>When reporting a fever to your doctor, don't attempt to convert from a rectal reading to an oral reading.<br>
 It's simpler to just report what the reading was and how you took it.<br><br>If you are really worried about how a child looks but cant put your finger on exactly what is wrong get them checked out by a doctor.<br>  It is sometimes difficult to describe exactly what it is that doesn’t seem right but these ‘hunches’ pay off surprisingly often.</p>
 <p style="color:red;"><b>Emergency signs that require a call for ambulance:</b></p>
 <ul>
 <li>Child is unresponsive to voice or physical stimulation (not just asleep)</li><br>
 <li>Child shows pauses in breathing for more than 10 seconds</li><br>
 <li>A blue or grey colour of the lips/tongue</li><br>
 <li>Child is struggling to breathe or exhausted from the effort of breathing</li><br>
 <li>An epileptic seizure is occurring and has not stopped after two minutes</li><br>
 <li>Uncontrolled bleeding despite pressure over a wound</li><br>
 </ul>
<p style="color:blue;"><b>Get medical help for a fever in these cases:</b></p><br>
<ul>
<li>If a baby is younger than 3 months of age and has a rectal temperature of 100.4 F (38.0 C) or higher. Even if your baby doesn't have other signs or symptoms, call your doctor just to be safe.</li><br>
<li>If a baby is older than 3 months of age and has a temperature of 102 F (38.9 C) or higher.</li><br>
<li>If a newborn has a lower-than-normal temperature — less than 97 F (38.1 C) rectally.</li><br>
<li>If a child younger than age 2 has a fever for longer than one day, or a child age 2 or older has a fever for longer than three days. If your child has a fever after being left in a very hot car, seek medical care immediately.</li><br>
