   <h1 style="font-size:250%;text-align:center;color:blue">The Snake Bite Attack First Aid</h1><br>
   <h1 style="front-size:100%;">A snake bite attack is a medical emergency.</h1>
   <br>
   <p1>Should you be bitten by a snake, it’s essential to get emergency treatment as quickly as possible. However, there are some tips that you should also keep in mind:</p1>
   <ul>
   	<li>Call 102 immediately.</li><br>
   	<li>Note the time of the bite.</li><br>
   	<li>Keep calm and still as movement can cause the venom to travel more quickly through the body.</li><br>
   	<li>Remove constricting clothing or jewelry because the area surrounding the bite will likely swell.</li><br>
   	<li>Don’t allow the victim to walk. Carry or transport them by vehicle.</li><br>
   	<li>Do not kill or handle the snake. Take a picture if you can but don’t waste time hunting it down.</li><br>  

<h1 style="front-size:100%;">SYMPTOMS</h1>
    <li>Two puncture wounds</li><br>
    <li>Swelling and redness around the wounds</li><br>
    <li>Pain at the bite site</li><br>
    <li>Difficulty breathing</li><br>
    <li>Vomiting and nausea</li><br>
    <li>Blurred vision</li><br>
    <li>Sweating and Salivating</li><br>
    <li>Numbness in the face and limbs</li><br>

   
      <h1 style="font-size:150%;">PREVENTION</h1><br>
   	<p1>There are also several outdated first aid techniques that are now believed to be unhelpful or even harmful: </p1><br><br>
   	<li>Do not use a tourniquet.</li><br>
   	<li>Do not cut into the snake bite.</li><br>
   	<li>Do not use a cold compress on the bite.</li><br>
   	<li>Do not give the person any medications unless directed by a doctor.</li><br>
    <li>Do not raise the area of the bite above the victim’s heart.</li><br>
   	<li>Do not attempt to suck the venom out by mouth.</li><br>
   	<li>Do not use a pump suction device. These devices were formerly recommended for pumping out snake venom, but it's now believed that they are more likely to do harm than good.</li><br>
    
</ul>
